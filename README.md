# Godot-CPP-Linux-VSCode-Full-Setup
A small ready-to-work Setup for Godot-Development with Linux and VSCode. Highly customizable, should also work with other IDE's

Just download and run "sh quick-setup.sh". It is recommended to start the script in a new terminal to track the progress. This setup will download and compile all needed resources, so you can directly start a Godot-C++ Development, or just upgrade your Godot-Games with GDNative-Librarys.

You can find a detailed introduction on our YouTube-Channel.
